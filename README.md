# Multi-Mode LED Controller on Raspberry Pi Pico

An advanced embedded systems project built on the RP2040 microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico), showcasing real-time peripheral control, finite state machine logic, and interactive input handling using minimal hardware.

## Features
- Red Tap button: Toggle red LED (digital output via GPIO)
- Yellow Hold button (0.5–2s): Adjust yellow LED brightness with potentiometer (ADC + PWM)
- Hold >2s: Cycle through LED modes — manual, blink, breathe, off
- Efficient use of GPIO, ADC, and PWM peripherals with time-based input conditioning
- Built entirely in MicroPython

## Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
- 1 push button
- 1 red LED
- 1 yellow LED
- 2 × 100Ω resistors
